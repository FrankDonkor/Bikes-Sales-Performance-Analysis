## Introduction
This analysis aims to understand bike sales patterns based on demographic, geographic, and lifestyle factors. The dataset provides a comprehensive overview of bike purchases, allowing for the identification of key trends and potential areas for improvement in sales strategies.

## Objectives
•	To analyse the bike purchases of customers by gender, marital status, educational level, age, occupation and region.

•	To identify customer segments with the highest purchase propensity.

•	To explore the relationship between income, commute distance, and bike purchase decisions.

## Data Source
The data for this analysis was derived from Kaggle.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
•	Data was loaded into Excel.

•	It was checked for spelling errors, missing values, and duplicates.

•	To simplify the analysis, I changed the initial letters of the Gender and Marital Status values from M, F, S, M to Male, Female, Single, Married.

•	I divided the income of our customers into three categories: low, middle, and high.
Low income earners refers to customers who earn less than $50,000, Middle income earners had incomes between $50,000 and $100,000, and high income earners ended up earning more than $100,000.

•	The data was found to be clean and did not contain any missing values or errors.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
I.	What were the general buying trends?

II.	Which gender, age group, and region were the most likely to purchase bicycles?

III.	Did the customer's commute distance, the number of cars they own, their income, and their occupation influence their bicycle purchase?

IV.	Was there a relationship between the customer's education level and bicycle purchase?

## Data Analysis and Visualization

The data was visualized using pivot charts (column, bar, line) and slicers to identify trends and patterns based on various demographic, geographic and lifestyle factors.

The key findings are: 

I.	Bicycles purchased by gender: Interest in purchasing a bicycle was roughly equal between males and females and between single and married people. Compared to males and females in North America and Europe who had a similar interest in purchasing a bicycle, males in the Pacific region were more interested in purchasing a bicycle than females.

II.	Males with the highest level of education; bachelor's and high school, were more interested in purchasing a bicycle than females, but except for males with a Graduate degree whose females were more interested, the remaining males and females showed roughly equal interest in purchasing a bicycle.

III.	Bicycle purchases by age group: Across all regions and education levels, middle-aged customers showed the most interest in purchasing a bicycle.

IV.	Commuting distance and bicycle purchased: Customers with a minimum commuting distance of 0-1 miles preferred to purchase a bicycle than customers with a longer commuting distance of 5 miles or more.

V.	Number of cars owned by customers and bicycles purchased: Customers who own a car or no car at all are more likely to be interested in purchasing a bicycle. Customers who own two or more cars are less interested in purchasing a bicycle.

VI.	Bicycles purchased according to customer's income and occupation: Low and middle-income earners were more interested in purchasing a bicycle than high-income earners. Professionals and skilled manual workers were most interested in purchasing a bicycle. The manual workers were the least interested in purchasing a bicycle.

## Recommendations
1.	The bicycle company should target middle-aged customers, customers with short commute distances, and customers who own one or no cars, as they are interested in purchasing bicycles to meet their high demand and maximise profits.
  
2.	The bicycle company's sales representatives should also focus on promoting their products to low and middle-income earners to increase bicycle purchases because they are more likely to afford a bicycle than a car and therefore choose a bicycle.
   
3.	Luxurious bikes can be made to attract the high-income earners and customers with more than two cars.

## Future Work
A survey should be conducted to determine the reasons for the low interest of bike purchases in the occupational sectors and among the customers with a particular educational level. This can be further analysed to provide insights into the likely core reasons for the low purchase of bikes among customers with specific educational levels, occupation sectors, as well as the bike companies’ efforts to increase customer satisfaction.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides useful insights and recommendations about the purchased bike sales performance. The bike companies can increase the sales and profitability of their bikes by implementing the recommendations.
